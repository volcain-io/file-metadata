# file-metadata-microservice
File metadata microservice based on Node.js/Express

1) I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
2) When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response.

Upload a file on this website:
```
https://serene-earth-84093.herokuapp.com/
```

Example output (size in bytes):
```
{ "size": 4711 }
```
